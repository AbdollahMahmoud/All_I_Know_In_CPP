    2023                     Miscelaneous                 Two

1- An object created from the built-in library <string> is merely an Array
   like in C Programming.

   Example:
   -------
        string s = "Yellow";
        std::cout<<s[1]; 
            output ==> e

2- An object created from the built-in library <vector> is also merely an Array
   with some extra features like: vector<ElementsDataType> VectorName(NumOfElements)

        i- Its elements get initialized automatically with Zeros

       ii- Might initialize the elements manually like this:
           vector<ElementsDataType> VectorName(NumOfElements, DesiredInitValue)

      iii- Has a Dynamic Size (Elements' Number). Meaning, you can extend/shrink the size 
           of the Array.
           Example:
           -------
                vector<int> a(10);
                a.push_back(3);
                    result ==> an Eleventh Element is added at the End of the array 
                    with a value of 3.
       
       iv- An Empty Vector can be created but Can only Be Initialized using the push_back:
            vector<int> a;
            a.push_back(3);

3- Arrays can be Sorted using the function sort(start, end) from 
   the built-in library <algorithm>
4- Arrays can also be Reversed using the function reverse(start, end) from 
   the built-in library <algorithm>
5- If the input is too big on CodeForces in example you can Copy It And Put It In A Text File
   and give it to the Compiler: freopen("File.txt", "r", stdin); instead of the cin>>..

6- The text file that he made might be useful.
